== What is Kustomize?
The main idea of kustomize, is that it enable you to "customize", standard yaml file (API Object definition).
So assume you have a deployment.yaml (Deployment Object) kustomize allow you to alter namespace, images, labels, etc..
Another use of Kustomize is that it allows you to creating a file that glues everything together, or even create a hierarchical relationship to “overrides” parent parameters.

== Deploy ArgoCD Operator
I will use ArgoCD operator as the way for exploring and explaining kustomize.

. kustomization.yaml
+
The main file where you define all your resources, so in the kustomization file we mention all resources, namespace that will include those resources, and a variable to be referenced in resources files.
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
namespace: argocd
commonLabels:
  app: argocd-operator
resources:
- argocd-namespace.yaml
- argocd-operatorgroup.yaml
- argocd-subscription.yaml
vars:
- name: ARGOCD_PROJECT_NAME
  objref:
    kind: Namespace
    name: argocd
    apiVersion: v1

. folder Structure

image::../../images/folder.png[width=300,height=380]
+
* base
+
A base is main folder where you put your main kustomization file, in our case we include the all resources in this file.
* overlay
+
An overlay is a kustomization that depends on another kustomization (normally the base).
So you will need a separate overlay for every specific targeted configuration, imagine the case where you will have a dev, prod, etc.
or in our case we have aws, and ibmcloud.
+
. Apply the kustomization

[source,bash]
----
oc apply -k overlays/ibmcloud
