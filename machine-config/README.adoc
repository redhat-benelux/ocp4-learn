== What is Machine Config (MC)

[[mc-definition]]
The idea is simply to have a kind of OS modifications managed by the OCP cluster. So think of Machine config as a series of patches or OS modifications and they are all managed by Machine Config Operator (MCO).

Lets have a look at a sample MC

<1> Label to be applied on this MachineConfig

So MachineConfig is the source of machine configuration and is used for installation and first-boot, as well as upgrades.
Using the ignition config format, you can manage machines.

*But which component actually manage, the MC custom resources?*

== https://github.com/openshift/machine-config-operator[Machine Config Operator (MCO)]

The Machine Config Operator (MCO) is a cluster-level operator. It manages the operating system and keeps the cluster up to date and configured.
One way to view the MCO is to treat the operating system itself as "just another Kubernetes component" that you can inspect and manage with oc.

MCO manages 3 sub-components.

** https://github.com/openshift/machine-config-operator/blob/master/docs/MachineConfigServer.md[machine-config-server] : Provide Ignition config to new machines joining the cluster. machine-config-server pods are running only on masters and should be used by all machines joining the cluster
** https://github.com/openshift/machine-config-operator/blob/master/docs/MachineConfigController.md[machine-config-controller] : Control the upgrade of machines to desired configurations defined by a MachineConfig object for sets of machines individually.

*** Further Sub-Components
. [[mco-tmpl-cntrlr]] TemplateController: responsible for generating the MachineConfigs for pre-defined roles of machines from internal templates based on cluster configuration.
. [[mco-updt-cntrlr]] UpdateController:  responsible for upgrading machines to desired MachineConfig by coordinating with a daemon running on each machine.
. [[mco-rndr-cntrlr]] RenderController: responsible for discovering MachineConfigs for a Pool of Machines and generating the static MachineConfig.
. [[mco-kube-cntrlr]] KubeletConfigController: responsible for wrapping custom Kubelet configurations within a CRD.

** https://github.com/openshift/machine-config-operator/blob/master/docs/MachineConfigDaemon.md[machine-config-daemon] : Apply new machine configuration during update. The MachineConfigDaemon receives machine configuration in the form of a "rendered" or merged MachineConfig.


[TIP]
====
Two Important keyword we need to remember

* https://github.com/coreos/ignition[Ignition]: MCO uses CoreOS Ignition as a configuration format. see https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/architecture/architecture-rhcos.html#rhcos-about-ignition_architecture-rhcos[About Ignition]
* https://github.com/coreos/rpm-ostree[rpm-ostree]: Operating system updates use rpm-ostree, with ostree updates encapsulated inside a container image.
====

So if the MC is like a patch or OS changes <<mc-definition,see Machine Config>>,
*then how MCO apply relevant patch to target machines ?*

== Machine Config Pool

The Machine Config Pool is the link between MC and target machines.
Letâ€™s examine the following sample to understand the Machine Config Pool.

[[mcp-sample-yaml]]
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfigPool <1>
metadata:
  name: worker
spec:
  machineConfigSelector: <2>
    matchLabels:
      machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: worker
  nodeSelector: <3>
    matchLabels:
      node-role.kubernetes.io/worker: ""
----
<1> Declaration of the MachineConfigPool
<2> Selector to select which Machine Config(s) that will be applied on this pool <<mc-sample-yaml,see Machine Config>>.
<3> Selector to select which node will be part of this pool.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* MachineSets vs MachineConfigPool

MachineSets describe nodes with respect to cloud / machine provider.
MachineConfigPool allows MachineConfigController components to define and provide status of machines in context of upgrades.
MachineConfigPool also allows users to configure how upgrades are rolled out to the machines in a pool.

NodeSelector can be replaced with reference to MachineSet.

====

So, previous <<mcp-sample-yaml,MCP>> will instruct the MCO (<<mco-rndr-cntrlr,RenderController>>) to select all MC with labels worker and merge all of them (static render) and the apply rendered MachineConfig file to node of worker (<<mco-updt-cntrlr,UpdateController>>).
The Render controller generates static machine config objects named rendered-worker-xxx. If the machine config pool changes, then the render controller creates a new rendered-xxx and applies it.

[TIP]
====
*Coordinate between UpdateController and the MachineConfigDaemon is done via node annotations*,

* machine-config-daemon.v1.openshift.com/currentConfig : defines the current MachineConfig applied by MachineConfigDaemon.
* machine-config-daemon.v1.openshift.com/desiredConfig : defines the desired MachineConfig that need to be applied by MachineConfigDaemon
* machine-config-daemon.v1.openshift.com/state : defines the state of the MachineConfigDaemon, It can be done, working and degraded.
* machineconfiguration.openshift.io/reason : defines the degraded reason or done.

With these three fields it becomes possible to determine the update progress of the machine:

. desiredConfig == currentConfig : The machine is up-to-date.
. desiredConfig != currentConfig && state == working : The machine is not up-to-date, but is in the process of updating.
. desiredConfig != currentConfig && state == degraded : The machine is not up-to-date and MachineConfigDaemon cannot apply the desired configuration.
